# Manual Meeting Links Guide

This guide explains how to use manual meeting links for demo sessions instead of Zoom OAuth integration.

## âœ… Benefits of Manual Meeting Links

- **No OAuth Setup Required** - Skip complex API configuration
- **Works with Any Platform** - Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, Jitsi, etc.
- **Full Admin Control** - Complete control over meeting creation
- **Simple & Reliable** - No API failures or token issues
- **Flexible** - Can be updated anytime

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### 1. Admin Creates Meeting

- Admin creates a meeting in their preferred video platform
- Copies the meeting link (e.g., `https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij`)

### 2. Create Demo Session

When creating a demo session, include the meeting link:

```json
{
  "session_date": "2025-08-01",
  "session_time": "15:00:00",
  "title": "Friday Demo Session",
  "description": "Weekly demo presentations",
  "max_scheduled": 8,
  "zoom_link": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "is_active": true
}
```

### 3. Students Get Link

- Students see the meeting link when they sign up
- Link is included in Slack notifications (if configured)
- Link is displayed in the frontend

## ðŸŽ¯ API Usage

### Create Demo Session with Meeting Link

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/demo-sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_date": "2025-08-01",
    "session_time": "15:00:00",
    "title": "Friday Demo Session",
    "description": "Weekly demo presentations",
    "max_scheduled": 8,
    "zoom_link": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
    "is_active": true
  }'
```

### Create Demo Session Without Link (Add Later)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/demo-sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_date": "2025-08-01",
    "session_time": "15:00:00",
    "title": "Friday Demo Session",
    "description": "Weekly demo presentations",
    "max_scheduled": 8,
    "zoom_link": null,
    "is_active": true
  }'
```

### Update Meeting Link Later

curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/demo-sessions/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "zoom_link": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
  }'
```

```bash
python scripts/test_manual_demo_creation.py
